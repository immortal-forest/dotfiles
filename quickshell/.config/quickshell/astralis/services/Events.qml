/**
 * astralis — local calendar events (ported from Ricelin
 * pill/Singletons/Events.qml), persisted as a plain JSON array at
 * ~/.cache/astralis/events.json (the astralis cache dir; Ricelin keeps it in
 * ~/.local/state/ricelin). The in-memory `events` is the source of truth:
 * add/remove mutate it and write the file, which is read back only at
 * startup. The file is deliberately NOT watched — re-reading our own write
 * races the FileView's cached text and dropped the just-added event (it
 * flashed in, then vanished until the next write). The file holds an array
 * of { id, date, endDate, time, endTime, text, recur } with date/endDate as
 * "YYYY-MM-DD". endDate is "" for a single-day entry, otherwise the last day
 * a multi-day span covers. time and endTime may be "" for an all-day or
 * open-ended entry. Because the keys are zero-padded "YYYY-MM-DD", a plain
 * string compare orders and spans dates correctly, so coverage tests need no
 * Date parsing.
 *
 * recur is "" for a one-off, "year" for a yearly entry (a birthday: shows on
 * its month and day in every year, matched on the "MM-DD" tail) or "month"
 * (shows on its day in every month, matched on the "DD" tail). A recurring
 * entry ignores its endDate. Day 31 monthly and Feb 29 yearly only land where
 * the day exists, which is fine for now. On load, entries written before this
 * field are classified once: a birthday-looking title becomes yearly, the
 * legacy yearly flag folds into recur, the rest stay one-off, and the healed
 * list is persisted so it sticks.
 *
 * A bare array is simpler than a JsonAdapter for a growing list: read the
 * text, JSON.parse, mutate the array, JSON.stringify back through setText.
 * (Ricelin's warning holds here too — a JsonAdapter round-trip through
 * writeAdapter parses stale file state back over the live list and loses
 * back-to-back mutations; verified before settling on setText.) Every parse
 * is guarded so a truncated or corrupt file never throws and never wipes the
 * singleton — a bad read just leaves the last good `events` in place.
 *
 * Ids come from a monotonic counter seeded past the highest id already on
 * disk, never Date.now() or Math.random() (both throw in this engine), so
 * every add is uniquely addressable for remove() even within the same minute.
